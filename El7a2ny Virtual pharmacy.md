## Code Styleüìú

Maintaining a uniform code style is crucial for the readability and maintainability of our project. To achieve this, we utilize Prettier, a renowned code formatter, to enforce consistent coding standards automatically.

### Using Prettier for Uniform Code Formatting
[Prettier](https://prettier.io/) is an automated code formatter that applies predefined styling rules to your code. This tool streamlines the development process by eliminating the need for manual enforcement of style guidelines, fostering efficient and collaborative coding practices.

### Contributing to the Project
When contributing to this project, please ensure to format your code with Prettier before submitting a pull request. This practice helps maintain alignment with our coding standards, contributing to a cohesive and well-organized codebase.

### Setting Up Prettier
For information on setting up and integrating Prettier into your development workflow, refer to the [Prettier official documentation](https://prettier.io/docs/en/install.html). Consider configuring Prettier as a pre-commit hook in your version control system to automate the formatting process before each commit.

### Our Goal
By adhering to a consistent code style with the help of Prettier, we aim to enhance code readability, streamline team collaboration, and facilitate a more efficient development process.

## Code Examples üê±‚Äçüíª

#**`` MongoDB Schema for Cart``**

Below is the MongoDB schema for the Cart model in the El7a2ny Pharmacy project:

```javascript
import mongoose, { Document, Schema } from 'mongoose';

// Interface defining the Cart document structure
interface ICart extends Document {
  userID: mongoose.Types.ObjectId;
  items: {
    id: mongoose.Types.ObjectId;
    count: number;
  }[];
}

// Schema definition for the Cart
const cartSchema = new Schema<ICart>(
  {
    userID: {
      type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
      ref: 'User',
      unique: true,
      required: true
    },
    items: [
      {
        id: {
          type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
          ref: 'Medicine',
          required: true
        },
        count: {
          type: Number,
          required: true
        }
      }
    ],
    default: []
  },
  { timestamps: true, toJSON: { virtuals: true }, toObject: { virtuals: true } }
);

// Index for efficient querying by userID
cartSchema.index({ userID: 1 }, { unique: true });

// Virtual field to calculate the total cost of the cart
cartSchema.virtual('total').get(async function (this: ICart) {
  await this.populate('items.id');
  return this.items.reduce(
    (acc, item) => acc + item.id.price * item.count,
    0
  );
});

// Cart model creation
const Cart = mongoose.model<ICart>('Cart', cartSchema);

export default Cart;

## Tests

In the development of the El7a2ny project, testing plays a crucial role in ensuring the reliability and functionality of our application. We employ a combination of Postman and Jest to comprehensively cover different aspects of testing.

### Postman for Backend Testing
For backend testing, we extensively use Postman. It is a vital tool in our development process for:

- Validating the functionality of our API endpoints.
- Ensuring responses and payloads are accurate and as expected.
- Facilitating the creation and execution of test suites for various API routes, enhancing the consistency and reliability of our backend services.
- examples 
- 
-![login](./screenshots/1.png)
-![cart](./screenshots/12.png)
-![increase item ](./screenshots/13.png)
-![Cart changed](./screenshots/14.png)
-![decrease item](./screenshots/16.png)
-![cart changed](./screenshots/17.png)


### Jest for Partial Testing
While Jest, a delightful JavaScript testing framework, is utilized in our project, it's important to note that not all components and functionalities are currently covered by Jest tests. However, we have integrated some Jest tests which are instrumental in:

- Validating the logic of individual components and functions.
- Ensuring key functionalities perform as intended.
- Offering a foundation for future comprehensive test coverage as the project evolves.

### Running the Tests
To execute the tests, follow these guidelines:

**For Postman:**
- Make sure your local server or the relevant environment is running.
- Any route from our API Refrence file can be used for testing, 
for example: you can use the route "http://localhost:3000/me/wallet" to get the user's wallet info
- Execute the tests within each collection to validate the backend API functionality.

**For Jest:**
- Navigate to the root directory of the project.
- Run `npm test` to execute the available Jest test suites.

Our approach to testing, combining Postman for backend APIs and Jest for specific components, aims to strike a balance between thorough validation and development agility. Future iterations of the project will likely expand on the Jest test coverage for a more comprehensive testing suite.
